# CPCluster Node

This crate implements a cluster node. Source files live in `src` and tests in `tests`.

- Start a node with `cargo run` after copying `join.json` from the master directory.
- Configuration is shared via `../config.json`.
- Run `cargo test` at the workspace root after modifying the code.
